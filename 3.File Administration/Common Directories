Filesystem Hierarchy

At this point, you're probably well familiar with the directory structure of your system, if not you will be soon. Filesystems can vary with how they are structured, but for the most part they should conform to the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

Go ahead and do an ls -l / to see the directories listed under the root directory, yours may look different than mine, but the directories should for the most part look like the following:

    / - The root directory of the entire filesystem hierarchy, everything is nestled under this directory.
    /bin - Essential ready-to-run programs (binaries), includes the most basic commands such as ls and cp.
    /boot - Contains kernel boot loader files.
    /dev - Device files.
    /etc - Core system configuration directory, should hold only configuration files and not any binaries.
    /home - Personal directories for users, holds your documents, files, settings, etc.
    /lib - Holds library files that binaries can use.
    /media - Used as an attachment point for removable media like USB drives.
    /mnt - Temporarily mounted filesystems.
    /opt - Optional application software packages.
    /proc - Information about currently running processes.
    /root - The root user's home directory.
    /run - Information about the running system since the last boot.
    /sbin - Contains essential system binaries, usually can only be ran by root.
    /srv - Site-specific data which are served by the system.
    /tmp - Storage for temporary files
    /usr - This is unfortunately named, most often it does not contain user files in the sense of a home folder. This is meant for user installed software and utilities, however that is not to say you can't add personal directories in there. Inside this directory are sub-directories for /usr/bin, /usr/local, etc.
    /var - Variable directory, it's used for system logging, user tracking, caches, etc. Basically anything that is subject to change all the time.


Common Directories
/  - 'root', the top of the file system hierarchy.

The linux directory structure is like a tree the base of the linux syystem hiearachy begins at the root, Directory will start to branch off the root but everything starts at root

/bin - Binaries and other executable programs. Programs are written in source code this is human readable text. The text files are then compiled to machine readable binaries.They called binaries because machine code is a strings of zeros and ones.

/etc - Find system config files.The files control how the OS or applications behave.e.g there is config file in /etc that tell the OS whether to boot into text mode or graphical mode.

/home - Home directories. Its separtes home data from another users data.


/opt - Optional or third party software live. For software that has not been bundled with the OS e.g google earth is not part of standard linux OS


/tmp - Temporary space, typically cleared on reboot. 

/usr - User related program stored.Sub directory structure wihinin usr you'll find binary and executables located in usr/bin/ .

/var - Variable data, most notably log files.Things that change often on a linux system are typically log files that are generated eiter by the OS itself or applications

Linux its called directories other might be called folders use interchangably
