A Fast Find-Locate
Locate is faster than find command looks at the path you gave it and evaluates each and every file and directory and determines if that matches you search pattern or not and then returns those results.

Locate works of an index typically the index is rebuilt everyday instead of evaluating each and every files that matches the pattern locate just does a look up index.The results are not in real time there is a lag between time the index is created and time that your run the locate command.

locate - Pattern
-List files that match pattern
-Faster than the find command
-Queries an index.
-Results are not in real time
-May not be enabled on all systems
