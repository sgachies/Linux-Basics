su ->[username] Change user ID or become superuser

-c -> command specify a command to be executed

Sudo - Super User Do
sudo - Execute a command as another user, typically the superuser
It is commonly used to install, start, stop application that require root priveleges.
Advantages of using sudo over the su commands is that you dont need to know other password of the other user. These can eliminate some issues that arise from using shared password and generic accounts
When you execute the sudo command you are prompted for your password if the sudo configuration permits that access then that command is  executed.
The sudo configuration is typically controlled by the systems administrator and requires root access to change off course on your personal system you have access to the root account and you are effectively the system administrator as well .

Using sudo 
sudo -l List avilable commands
sudo command Run command as root 
sudo -u root Command same as above
sudo -u user Command Run as user

Using Sudo
sudo su              ->Switch to the superuser account
